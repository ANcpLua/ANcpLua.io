# AL0002: Don't repeat negated patterns

The negated pattern should not be repeated multiple times.

## When it triggers

```csharp
// Warning: Use 'not' only once or not at all
if (x is not not null) { }  // AL0002 - double negation
```

## Why this matters

Double negation in patterns is confusing and makes code harder to read. It's equivalent to not using negation at all.

## How to fix

Remove the redundant negation:

```csharp
if (x is null) { }      // Clear intent
if (x is not null) { }  // Clear intent
```

## Configuration

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.AL0002.severity = warning
```
