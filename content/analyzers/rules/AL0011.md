# AL0011: Avoid lock keyword on non-Lock types

The lock keyword on object/non-Lock types should be replaced with the Lock class from System.Threading.

## When it triggers

```csharp
private readonly object _syncRoot = new();

// AL0011: Use 'Lock _lock = new()' with 'lock(_lock)' instead
lock (_syncRoot)
{
    // Critical section
}
```

## Why this matters

.NET 9 introduced `System.Threading.Lock`, a dedicated type for synchronization that provides better performance than locking on `object`. Using `Lock` also makes the intent clearer and enables future runtime optimizations.

## How to fix

Replace `object` with `Lock`:

```csharp
private readonly Lock _lock = new();

lock (_lock)
{
    // Critical section
}
```

## Requirements

- .NET 9.0 or later
- C# 13 or later

## Configuration

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.AL0011.severity = warning
```
