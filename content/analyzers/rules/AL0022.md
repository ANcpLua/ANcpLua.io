# AL0022: Mixed form collection and DTO

Mixing `IFormCollection` with a `[FromForm]` DTO in the same endpoint is not supported.

## When it triggers

```csharp
// Error: Endpoint 'Submit' mixes [FromForm] IFormCollection with [FromForm] DTO
public class Controller
{
    void Submit([FromForm] IFormCollection form, [FromForm] FormData data) { }  // AL0022
}
```

## Why this matters

`IFormCollection` represents raw access to all form fields, while a `[FromForm]` DTO provides structured binding. These approaches are mutually exclusive:
- Both try to consume the same form data
- Using both creates semantic confusion
- Pick one approach: dynamic or strongly-typed

## How to fix

Choose one approach:

### Option 1: Use structured DTO (recommended)
```csharp
public class FormData
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
}

public class Controller
{
    void Submit([FromForm] FormData data) { }
}
```

### Option 2: Use raw IFormCollection
```csharp
public class Controller
{
    void Submit([FromForm] IFormCollection form)
    {
        var name = form["name"];
        var email = form["email"];
    }
}
```

## Configuration

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.AL0022.severity = error
```
