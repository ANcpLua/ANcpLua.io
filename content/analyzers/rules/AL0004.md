# AL0004: Use pattern matching for Span constant comparison

When comparing Span and a constant, use pattern matching instead of equality operators, unless you want to compare addresses.

## When it triggers

```csharp
ReadOnlySpan<char> span = "hello";

// Warning: Use pattern matching instead of equality operators
if (span == "hello") { }  // AL0004
```

## Why this matters

Using `==` on Span types compares references/addresses, not content. Pattern matching (`is`) performs content comparison, which is almost always the intended behavior.

## How to fix

Use pattern matching:

```csharp
ReadOnlySpan<char> span = "hello";

if (span is "hello") { }  // Compares content
```

## Configuration

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.AL0004.severity = warning
```
