# AL0006: Field name conflicts with primary constructor parameter

Field names should not conflict with primary constructor parameters to avoid shadowing and confusion.

## When it triggers

```csharp
public class Example(int value)
{
    private int value;  // AL0006: Field 'value' conflicts with primary constructor parameter
}
```

## Why this matters

When a field has the same name as a primary constructor parameter, it shadows the parameter. This leads to confusion about which `value` is being referenced in different contexts and can cause subtle bugs.

## How to fix

Rename the field to avoid conflict:

```csharp
public class Example(int value)
{
    private int _value = value;  // Clear naming, no conflict
}
```

## Configuration

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.AL0006.severity = warning
```
