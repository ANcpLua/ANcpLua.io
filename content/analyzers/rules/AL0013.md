# AL0013: Missing telemetry schema URL

Setting the schema URL allows collectors and backends to understand which version of semantic conventions your telemetry uses.

## When it triggers

```csharp
// AL0013: OpenTelemetry resource configuration should include 'telemetry.schema_url' attribute
builder.ConfigureResource(resource => resource
    .AddService("MyService"));
```

## Why this matters

The `telemetry.schema_url` attribute tells observability backends which version of OpenTelemetry semantic conventions your telemetry uses. Without it:
- Backends can't automatically transform attribute names
- Queries may break when conventions change
- Interoperability between services becomes harder

## How to fix

Add the schema URL to your resource configuration:

```csharp
builder.ConfigureResource(resource => resource
    .AddService("MyService")
    .AddAttributes(new Dictionary<string, object>
    {
        ["telemetry.schema_url"] = "https://opentelemetry.io/schemas/1.21.0"
    }));
```

## Configuration

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.AL0013.severity = suggestion
```
