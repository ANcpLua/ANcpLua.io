# AL0003: Don't divide by constant zero

Integers and Decimal should never be divided by the constant 0 as this causes a DivideByZeroException at runtime.

## When it triggers

```csharp
// Error: Division by constant zero will throw DivideByZeroException
int result = x / 0;      // AL0003
decimal d = amount / 0;  // AL0003
int mod = x % 0;         // AL0003
```

## Why this matters

Division by zero with integers or decimals throws `DivideByZeroException` at runtime. This is always a bug when the divisor is a constant zero.

Note: Floating-point division by zero does not throw; it produces infinity or NaN.

## How to fix

Remove the dead code or fix the logic:

```csharp
int result = x / divisor;  // Use a variable that can be validated
if (divisor != 0)
    result = x / divisor;
```

## Configuration

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.AL0003.severity = error
```
