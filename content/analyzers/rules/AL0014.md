# AL0014: Prefer pattern matching for null and zero comparisons

Pattern matching syntax (is/is not) is more expressive and idiomatic. For null checks, it also bypasses overloaded equality operators.

## When it triggers

```csharp
// AL0014: Use 'x is null' instead of 'x == null'
if (x == null) { }

// AL0014: Use 'x is not null' instead of 'x != null'
if (x != null) { }

// AL0014: Use 'count is 0' instead of 'count == 0'
if (count == 0) { }
```

## Why this matters

**For null checks:**
- `x == null` may invoke an overloaded `==` operator
- `x is null` always performs a reference comparison
- Pattern matching is the idiomatic C# way to check for null

**For zero checks:**
- Pattern matching provides consistency with null checks
- More readable and expressive

## How to fix

Use pattern matching:

```csharp
if (x is null) { }
if (x is not null) { }
if (count is 0) { }
if (count is not 0) { }
```

## Configuration

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.AL0014.severity = suggestion
```
